Setup:

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a .env file with your username & password at the project root. In the .env file you should have IG_USERNAME=<your_username> and IG_PASSWORD=<your_password> on separate lines; i.e.

```IG_USERNAME=BestUsername
```IG_PASSWORD=unhackablePW42

3. Run the start script (`npm start`) and you should be good to go!
